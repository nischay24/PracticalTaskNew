##Concept for further development

### Checks that can be added to the current tests:
1. The content of page title can be matched and validated
2. Check if the grade is less than or equal to 5

### Next recommended test
1. Click on "View all positive reviews" and check if all the filtered reviews contain only 4-star or 5-star ratings
2. Similarly, Click on "View all critical reviews" and check if all the filtered reviews contain only 1-star or 2-star or 3-star ratings
3. Filter 2-star reviews, and ensure that every review has exactly two stars. The same test for 3,4 and 5 stars
4. Click on "continue reading" of Most relevant positive review, check if the popup appears with full review. Similar test when "continue reading" of Most relevant critical review is clicked
